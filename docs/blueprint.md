## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Moderate blue (#64B5F6) to evoke trust and cleanliness, without being cliché. This blue is versatile and contrasts well with light backgrounds.
- Background color: Light blue-gray (#F0F4F8), a desaturated shade of the primary blue, creates a clean, professional backdrop.
- Accent color: Slightly purple blue (#5C6BC0), contrasting in brightness and saturation with the primary, to highlight key actions and data points.
- Headline font: 'Poppins', a geometric sans-serif, gives a modern and fashionable feel. Body font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look, will work well for the app body. It has clear legibility.
- Use a set of modern, outline-style icons that represent different data points and actions within the app. These icons should be easily recognizable and complement the overall design.
- A clean and intuitive layout with a focus on usability. Key information should be easily accessible. Use clear visual hierarchy to guide the user through the app.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience. For example, loading animations, confirmation animations, and interactive hover effects.
